  <h2>Research Topics</h2>

  <p>Our faculty supports a diverse range of scientific inquiries. Based on your proposal, we are particularly interested in the following topics, ranked by priority:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Transforming H<sub>2</sub>O into fuel and its potential in renewable energy (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).</li>
    <li>Assessing cognitive efficiency in jazz musicians under variable lighting conditions and audience fluctuation (impact of 2 × 10<sup>3</sup> expanding to 2 × 10<sup>4</sup>).</li>
    <li>Innovative <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> implementations for musical composition display.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Please provide a comprehensive outline of these projects, including estimated duration, personnel, and required resources.</p>

  <h2>Traditional Dance Studies</h2>

  <p>Indeed! My postgraduate research included an analysis of cultural dance forms. My favorite ones are:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Pacific Islander Rain Dance</dt>
    <dd>Performed in ceremonial circles, this dance was believed to invoke rainfall for agricultural prosperity.</dd>
    <dt>Norse Ice Glide</dt>
    <dd>Practiced in pre-modern Scandinavia, participants would shuffle rapidly on frozen surfaces to generate warmth, inspiring modern ice skating techniques.</dd>
    <dt>Alaskan Frost Step</dt>
    <dd>Once misinterpreted as an avant-garde dance style, the stiff movements observed by early explorers were later attributed to extreme cold.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Sincerely,</p>
